# Email Configuration Guide

## Current Status
The email system now uses **Supabase's built-in email service** - the same infrastructure used for authentication emails (magic links, signup confirmations).

## Email Strategy

### âœ… Supabase Email Service (Current)
- **Same as Auth**: Uses the exact same email infrastructure as magic links and signup
- **No Additional Setup**: Works immediately with your existing Supabase configuration
- **Real Emails**: Actually sends emails to students (not just console logging)
- **Reliable**: Leverages Supabase's proven email delivery system

### How It Works
The system uses `service.auth.admin.sendEmail()` which:
- Uses your Supabase project's email configuration
- Sends real emails through Supabase's infrastructure
- Works with the same SMTP settings as your auth emails
- No additional API keys or services needed

## Email Content
The system sends professional HTML emails with:
- ðŸŽ“ University branding
- Student assignment details
- Supervisor contact information
- Next steps for the student
- Professional formatting

## Testing
- **Real Emails**: Emails are actually sent to student addresses
- **Same as Auth**: Uses the same delivery system as your magic links
- **Check Supabase Dashboard**: Monitor email delivery in your Supabase project

## Current Email Flow
1. Admin creates assignment â†’ No email sent
2. Admin clicks "Send Email" â†’ Confirmation dialog appears
3. Admin confirms â†’ Email is sent via Supabase email service
4. Student receives notification about their assignment
