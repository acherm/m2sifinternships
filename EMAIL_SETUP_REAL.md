# 📧 Real Email Setup Guide

## Current Status
- ✅ **Console Logging**: Working perfectly (see your server console)
- ❌ **Real Emails**: Not being sent (only logged to console)

## 🚀 Option 1: Quick Setup with Resend (Recommended)

### Step 1: Create Resend Account
1. Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Sign up for free account
3. Verify your domain or use their test domain

### Step 2: Get API Key
1. In Resend dashboard, go to "API Keys"
2. Create new API key
3. Copy the key

### Step 3: Add to Environment
Add to your `.env.local`:
```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxx
```

### Step 4: Update API Route
Replace the console logging in `/app/api/notifications/assignment/route.ts` with:

```typescript
// Add this import at the top
import { Resend } from 'resend'

// Replace the console logging section with:
const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY)

const { data, error } = await resend.emails.send({
  from: 'noreply@yourdomain.com', // or use Resend's test domain
  to: [studentEmail],
  subject: "🎓 Internship Assignment Confirmation - M2 SIF",
  html: emailHtml,
})

if (error) {
  console.error("Resend error:", error)
  return NextResponse.json({ error: "Failed to send email" }, { status: 500 })
}

return NextResponse.json({ 
  success: true, 
  message: "Email sent successfully via Resend",
  emailData: { to: studentEmail, subject: "🎓 Internship Assignment Confirmation - M2 SIF", student: studentName, subjectTitle, supervisor: supervisorName }
})
```

### Step 5: Install Resend
```bash
npm install resend
```

## 🚀 Option 2: Use Existing Email Service

If you already have an email service (SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.), we can integrate it similarly.

## 🚀 Option 3: Keep Console Logging

For development/testing, the current console logging works perfectly and shows all email content.

## 📋 Test Real Emails

After setup:
1. Make an assignment
2. Click "Send Email" 
3. Confirm in dialog
4. Check your email inbox!

## 💡 Pro Tip

You can test with Resend's built-in test domain first:
```typescript
from: 'onboarding@resend.dev'
```

This works immediately without domain verification.
