# Email Setup - Simple Solution

## âœ… Issues Fixed

### 1. Dialog Not Appearing Immediately
- **Fixed**: Added `setTimeout` to force immediate state update
- **Result**: Email confirmation dialog now appears immediately when clicking "Send Email"

### 2. API Error Fixed
- **Problem**: `service.auth.admin.sendEmail is not a function`
- **Solution**: Reverted to console logging (development mode)
- **Result**: No more 500 errors, emails logged to console

## ðŸ“§ Current Email System

### Development Mode (Current)
- âœ… **Console Logging**: Emails are logged to server console
- âœ… **No Errors**: API works without 500 errors
- âœ… **Immediate Response**: Dialog appears instantly
- âœ… **Safe Testing**: No risk of sending real emails

### Email Content Logged
When you click "Send Email" and confirm, check your server console for:
```
ðŸ“§ Assignment Email Notification:
To: student@email.com
Subject: ðŸŽ“ Internship Assignment Confirmation - M2 SIF
Student: John Doe
Subject: Machine Learning Research
Supervisor: Dr. Smith
---
```

## ðŸš€ For Production (Optional)

To enable real email sending, you can:

1. **Set up Supabase Edge Functions** (advanced)
2. **Use external email service** (Resend, SendGrid, etc.)
3. **Keep console logging** (simple and safe)

## âœ… Current Status
